# Databasus physical-restore helper.
#
# Takes a restore bundle produced by the Databasus restore stream, decompresses
# what needs decompressing, runs pg_combinebackup over the full + incremental
# chain, and wires up WAL replay / point-in-time recovery.
#
# Usage:
#   sh databasus-recovery.sh [--pg-bin <dir>] [--combine-image <image>] [--target-time <utc-ts>] <bundle-url-or-path> [output-dir]
#
#   --pg-bin <dir>        directory holding the PostgreSQL tools (pg_combinebackup,
#                         pg_ctl) when they are not on PATH.
#   --combine-image <img> run pg_combinebackup inside this Docker image instead of on
#                         the host - for hosts that have zstd but no PostgreSQL tools.
#                         The host still decompresses the backup blobs and WAL with its
#                         zstd; only the version-specific pg_combinebackup runs in the
#                         container, and the started cluster needs no extra tools.
#   --target-time <ts>    point-in-time recovery target, a PostgreSQL-parseable UTC
#                         timestamp (e.g. '2026-06-12 14:30:00+00:00'). Replays WAL
#                         up to this point and promotes; omit to replay all shipped
#                         WAL (latest). Ignored when the bundle ships no WAL.
#   <bundle-url-or-path>  an http(s):// restore-stream URL (with its token) or a
#                         path to an already-downloaded .tar bundle.
#   [output-dir]          where to build the restore (default: databasus-restore).
