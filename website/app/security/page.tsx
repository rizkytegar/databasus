              <p className="text-lg text-gray-400">
                Databasus is responsible for sensitive data:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>it accesses your DB;</li>
                <li>it backs it up (meaning makes a copy of data);</li>
                <li>
                  it keeps credentials to be able to access your DB on a regular
                  basis;
                </li>
                <li>
                  it saves backups in your S3 or other cloud storages (if you enable it);
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Therefore,{" "}
                <strong>
                  there is a main priority for Databasus to be enterprise-level
                  secure and reliable
                </strong>
                .
              </p>

              <p>To make sure:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>sensitive data is never exposed and always encrypted;</li>
                <li>
                  backups are encrypted and useless even if someone sees them in
                  the cloud storage;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Databasus doesn&apos;t even receive access to DB with write
                  or update access;
                </li>
                <li>all actions are logged and can be audited;</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                All these steps protect your data. As you know, there is no 100%
                secure system, but we do our best to make it as secure as
                possible. Even in case of hacking, nobody will be able to
                corrupt your data.
              </p>

              <p>Databasus enforces security on three levels:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Sensitive data encryption;</li>
                <li>Backups encryption;</li>
                <li>Read-only access to DB.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 id="level-1-sensitive-data-encryption">
                Level 1: sensitive data encryption
              </h2>

              <p>
                Internally, Databasus uses PostgreSQL DB to store connection
                details, configs, settings of notifiers and storages (S3, Google
                Drive, Dropbox, etc.).
              </p>

              <p>Any sensitive data is encrypted. For example:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>passwords</li>
                <li>tokens</li>
                <li>webhooks with secrets</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                So in DB Databasus keeps only hashes or encoded values. For
                encryption is used <strong>AES-256-GCM</strong> algorithm. Also,
                despite the encryption, those values are never exposed via API
                or UI.
              </p>

              <p>
                The secret key used for encryption is stored on local storage (
                <code>./databasus-data/secret.key</code> by default) and is not
                present in the DB itself. So DB compromise doesn&apos;t give
                access to sensitive data.
              </p>

              <h2 id="level-2-backups-encryption">
                Level 2: backups encryption
              </h2>

              <p>
                Each backup file is encrypted on the fly during backup creation.
                Databasus uses <strong>AES-256-GCM</strong> encryption
                algorithm, which ensures that backup data cannot be read without
                the encryption key and any tampering is detected during
                decryption.
              </p>

              <p>Backups flow through this pipeline:</p>

              <div className="relative my-6">
                <pre className="overflow-x-auto rounded-lg bg-gray-900 p-4 text-sm text-gray-100">
                  <code>{encryptionPipeline}</code>
                </pre>
                <div className="absolute right-2 top-2">
                  <CopyButton text={encryptionPipeline} />
                </div>
              </div>

              <p>
                Each backup gets its own unique encryption key derived from:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Master key (stored in{" "}
                  <code>./databasus-data/secret.key</code>)
                </li>
                <li>Backup ID</li>
                <li>Random salt (unique per backup)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>Result</strong>: Even if someone gains access to your
                cloud storage (S3, Google Drive, etc.), they cannot read the
                backups without your master key.
              </p>

              <h2 id="level-3-read-only-access">
                Level 3: read-only access to DB
              </h2>

              <p>
                Databasus enforces the principle of least privilege - it only
                needs read access to create backups, never write access. This
                protects your database from accidental or malicious data
                corruption through the backup tool.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before accepting database credentials, Databasus performs
                checks across three levels:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Role-level</strong>: Verifies the user is NOT a
                  superuser and cannot create roles or databases
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Database-level</strong>: Ensures no CREATE or TEMP
                  privileges
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Table-level</strong>: Confirms zero write permissions
                  (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, etc.)
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                The database user must pass all three checks to be considered
                read-only. If any write privilege is detected, Databasus will
                warn you.
              </p>

              <p>
                Databasus suggests creating read-only users for you with proper
                permissions:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Grants SELECT on all current and future tables</li>
                <li>Grants USAGE on schemas (but not CREATE)</li>
                <li>Explicitly revokes all write privileges</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>Result</strong>: Even if Databasus is compromised,
                server is hacked, secret key is stolen and credentials are
                decrypted, attackers cannot corrupt your database.
              </p>

              <h2 id="security-and-reliability-engineering">
                🛡️ Security &amp; reliability engineering
              </h2>

              <p>
                Databasus works with sensitive data, so preventing
                vulnerabilities, unauthorised access and data leaks is a primary
                concern. We invest in this on both sides of the system: in the
                code itself (permission checks, encryption, careful handling of
                secrets) and in the infrastructure around it (dependency
                analysis, CVE response, DevSecOps practices). The pipeline below
                runs automatically on every commit and PR — no single layer is
                enough on its own, but together they reduce the chance of
                vulnerable code, unsafe dependencies, broken images, or
                non-restorable backups reaching a release.
              </p>

              <h3 id="static-analysis">Static analysis</h3>

              <p>
                Static analysis runs in several independent passes. CodeQL
                scans the full codebase for security issues. CodeRabbit reviews
                every PR and runs <strong>gitleaks</strong> for secret scanning
                and <strong>semgrep</strong> for security rules inline.
                Dockerfiles and CI workflows get extra rules of their own
                (pinned action references, least-privilege permissions,
                suspicious base images), so insecure patterns are flagged
                before they ever merge.
              </p>

              <p>
                On top of these per-PR checks,{" "}
                <strong>Codex Security</strong> from OpenAI runs regular,
                deeper audits of the whole codebase. It is a separate program
                that catches architectural and cross-cutting issues which
                narrow PR-time scans miss.
              </p>

              <h3 id="dependency-management">Dependency management</h3>

              <p>
                Dependabot watches all of our dependencies against the GitHub
                Advisory Database and surfaces CVEs within minutes of
                publication. Updates run through a cooldown so newly-published
                versions get a chance to mature before we adopt them — a
                deliberate defence against compromised-package incidents like
                supply-chain attacks.
              </p>

              <p>
                The <strong>Dependency Review Action</strong> blocks any PR
                that introduces a new <strong>HIGH</strong> or{" "}
                <strong>CRITICAL</strong> CVE outright.

                  which have been an active attack vector in 2025.

                Critical paths are covered by both unit and integration tests,
                run against real database containers for every supported engine
                and major version.
              </p>

              <p>
                Restore is the path that matters most for a backup tool, so we
                test it explicitly: every PR runs full backup-then-restore
                cycles against those same real containers, verifying that
                backups can actually be restored end-to-end — not just written
                successfully.
              </p>

              <p>
                The rest of the CI/CD pipeline runs lint, type-check, the full
                test suite, image smoke tests and multi-architecture builds on
                every PR. A release only ships if all of it passes.
